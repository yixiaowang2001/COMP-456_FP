## 1 Project Description

### 1.1 Project Description

Orianna Wang, Liz Cao, and Eric Wang, in Group Six, study the topic of the cost and affordability of healthy diets worldwide and also provide information in specific countries. In recent years, more and more people are paying attention to what food they have per day and the adequate calories required per day. The food security issue draws attention either from the public or policymakers. Food security, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 1996, is “when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO, 1996). We may all be aware that the food security issue is unbalanced. While some people can achieve adequate food requirements, others might suffer from hunger and even lose their lives because of insufficient intake. Diverse types of food are needed to sustain our healthy life. However, more nutritious and healthy food costs more. To save money, people may select less nutritious food resulting in less healthy meals. According to Afshin et al. (2019), poor diets contribute to $\frac{1}{5}$ adult deaths through insufficient and excessive intake of unhealthy food.
